    "# SheHacks 2020: Pandas Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a popular python library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.  It is inspired by R's `data.frame` and bears many resemblences to SQL and other tabular data tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will serve as a basic introduction to pandas' capabilities.  For more, I encourage you to read the docs, browse blog posts, and read questions and answers on stack overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/1.0.0/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of useful examples from Chris Albon: https://chrisalbon.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack overlow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How To Install Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas relies on several other python libraries.  The easiest way to install pandas is to download the anaconda release of python.  **Be sure to download python 3.x since python 2.7 is no longer being maintained**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have a python installation with `pip`, you can install pandas with\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install pandas`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Will Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be a very low level workshop intented to get you comfortable working with dataframes.  In particular, I'm going to focus on the basics but will show you some other things pandas is capable of.  I'll do my best to follow the Pareto Rule of 80% simple and useful things, 20% cool things that you can reference should you need them.\n",
